--Design of a single Band Dielectric Resonator Bandpass Filter Coupling Matrix--

The MATLAB/GNU OCTAVE code give the main [N x N] Coupling Matrix M, The termination impedance matrix R,
and the plots for magnitude of S(1,1) and S(2,1) parameters of the filter response.

The script input the characteristics of desired Bandpass Filter response:
1. Order of the filter (n)
2. Resonant Frequency (in GHz)
3. 3dB Bandwidth (in MHz)
4. Return loss (in dB)

Detailed theory and design examples about Coupling matrix synthesis of bandpass filter can be found in [1]
